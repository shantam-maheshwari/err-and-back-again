            "content": "ISO Week Date . Handling date formats is probably the second-worst pain one can inflict upon a developer - the worst being handling time zones, of course (soon brother, soon). But what say you is the week 01 day 01 of the year? Participate in either of the polls below: . LinkedIn Poll . When does week 01 of a year start? . &mdash; Shantam Maheshwari (@knuthian_hero) March 5, 2022 . Before we get to the answer, according to ISO 8601 (the gold standard) the correct way to format dates is YYYY-MM-DD. Makes sense, at least to anyone who‚Äôs ever had to sort records by date (see URL - press Ctrl + L üéÖüèø). . . Ok, let‚Äôs dive in! . ISO 8601 . The What . The ISO 8601 definition for week 01 is the week with the first Thursday of the Gregorian year (i.e. of January) in it. . . The How . Let‚Äôs break it down to two simple steps. . Forget about 1 January for a moment. | Find the first Thursday of the year. | Find the Monday of the week (Monday to Sunday) containing it. | Here‚Äôs an example. Let‚Äôs find week 01 day 01 of the year 2022. Fire up the calendar on your system and follow along. . First Thursday of the year is 06-01-2022. (I‚Äôm using DD-MM-YYYY. Sue me!) | The Monday of the week containing it is 03-01-2022. | Hence, week 01 day 01 of 2022 is 3 January. . The Implications (Part 1) . How about week 01 day 01 of the year 2020? . First Thursday of the year is 02-01-2020. | The Monday of the week containing it is 30-12-2019. | Yes, you that read right. The week 01 day 01 of the year 2020 is 30 December 2019! . The Why . It is the first week with a majority (4 or more) of its days in January. | Its first day is the Monday nearest to 1 January. | It has the year‚Äôs first working day in it, if Saturdays, Sundays and 1 January are not working days. | I personally find the first reason the most compelling. . The Why Not . That is all good and dandy but‚Ä¶ why not use 1 January? If you come to think of it, there aren‚Äôt good enough excuses as to why we should. The reason the year shouldn‚Äôt always start from 1 January is because then, for each year the weeks would start on a different day (the day 1 January falls on). . Story time . I recently developed a database partitioning tool at work (check out my LinkedIn). While creating weekly partitions, I found that Oracle Database provides two options for working with weeks, namely WW and IW. After some Google-fu, I came across this enlightening discussion on AskTom. . The trunc function truncates dates to the option provided. For instance, . select trunc(to_date(&#39;05-MAR-2022&#39;), &#39;MONTH&#39;) from dual; -- 01-MAR-22 . For weeks, . select trunc(to_date(&#39;01-JAN-2022&#39;), &#39;WW&#39;) from dual; -- 01-JAN-22 -- WW defines week 01 day 01 as 1 January select trunc(to_date(&#39;01-01-2022&#39;), &#39;IW&#39;) from dual; -- 27-DEC-22 -- IW follows the ISO definition . To see the week number, . select to_char(trunc(to_date(&#39;01-01-2022&#39;)), &#39;IW&#39;) from dual; -- 52 -- 01-01-2022 lies in week 52 of year 2021 . The Implications (Part 2) . print(365/7, 365%7) # 52.142857142857146 1 print(366/7, 366%7) # 52.285714285714285 2 . Going by WW or the 1 January definition, there will always be 53 weeks in a year (week 53 having 1 or 2 days). | Going by IW or the ISO definition, some years will have 52 weeks, some 53 (all weeks having 7 days). | Further Reading . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601 |",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. .
